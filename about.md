Hello! My name is Andrew Scheiner and thank you for taking the time to check out my website. I am a Technical Account Manager for LinkIt!, an educational software company in New York City. I grew up in Allentown, PA, but I moved to Secaucus, NJ, for work. I graduated from Dickinson College with a B.S. in Computer Science and Data Analytics. My experience outside of my current job involves sports analytics, game theory analysis, automated testing, and software development. I am particularly interested in personal projects that involve sports, especially fantasy sports projections and sports betting models. I am also extremely interested in working in fields such as educational and medical software.

#### Role at LinkIt!
As a Technical Account Manager, my job is to be the expert technical partner for educators who rely on LinkIt!—a robust software solution they use every day to administer tests, manage grades, and pull powerful reports on student data. I manage a portfolio of about 40 accounts, and when technical complications pop up, I jump in to ensure things get back on track quickly. My day-to-day involves hands-on data management, which means helping to manage class rosters, uploading complex data files, generating customized analysis reports, and fixing any applicable errors that might slow down a classroom. Essentially, I make sure teachers can focus on teaching, not troubleshooting. To provide this robust support, I regularly utilize my skills in SQL coding for deep data work and Salesforce for effective client relationship management.

#### Technical Background
During Summer 2022, I completed a data analytics internship for Dickinson's athletics department, where I helped analyze data on both recruits and the men's basketball team. During the summers of 2023 and 2024, I was a software development intern at B. Braun Medical. I worked with the incredible R&D Digital Tech department in Allentown. My main task at B. Braun was to expand unit testing and code coverage for their DoseTrac© Enterprise software.

#### Research
When I was an undergrad, I worked with Professors Barry Tesman and Eren Bilen at Dickinson to investigate the significance of the tip-off in professional basketball. In August 2023, I presented the first iteration of our work at the MAA's MathFest in Tampa, Florida. In the fall of 2024, we finalized our publication on our work, which is currently under review. We also had **2** featured articles about our work on the Dickinson newsletter.

In addition, Prof. Bilen, Prof. Tesman, and I conducted research revolving around the use of neural networks in Python to find an optimal strategy at winning "Turning Point" (also known as Shut the Box) an old math-faceted board game which I recently created an online version for - you can find the game on the home page of my website under my personal project section. I recommend that you check it out!

#### School Involvement
At Dickinson, I was both a Resident Advisor and a tour guide for two years, and I was the assistant coach and treasurer for our club baseball team. I was also a founding father of Dickinson College's chapter of the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity.

#### Fun Facts and Interests
Some fun facts about me: I am a diehard Texas Rangers fan, I play disc golf and golf when the weather is nice, and I love working out. While I have been playing baseball consistently since I was about five years old, I recently joined a slow-pitch softball league to continue my passion for the game.
