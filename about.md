Hello! My name is Andrew Scheiner and thank you for taking the time to check out my new website hosted by GitHub pages.
I live in Allentown, Pennsylvania and I am currently a junior at Dickinson College (Carlisle, PA) pursuing a B.S. with a double major in both Computer Science and Data Analytics. 
At school, I am a Resident Advisor, tour guide, and an executive/coach/captain for our club baseball team.
My experience in my fields of interest includes data analysis and visualization, app and web development, research, and coding through college courses and jobs.
During Summer 2022, I completed a data analytics internship for Dickinson's athletics department and this past summer (2023), I completed a software development internship at B. Braun Medical working with the R&D Digital Tech department in Allentown. My main task at B. Braun was to work on unit testing and code coverage for their DoseTracÂ© Enterprise software. In addition, in summer 2023, I presented at the MAA's MathFest in Tampa, Florida for research I completed on investigating the significance of the jumpball in professional basketball.

My current project is continuing my research on the jumpball in basketball, where I am interested in more advanced factors such as jumper's combine performance, NBA standings (team's records), and betting influences, with my main goal is to get published. In the near future, I plan on doing research revolving around the use of AI to find an optimal strategy at winning "Turning Point" an old math-faceted board game which I recently created an online version of - found on the home page of website under my personal project section. I recommend that you check it out!

Some fun facts about me: I am a diehard Texas Rangers fan, I have been playing baseball consistently since I was about five years old, I am a video game enthusiast, and I love working out.

Please feel free to check out my socials included on the bottom of the page and please email me with any questions you might have!
