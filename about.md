Hello! My name is Andrew Scheiner and thank you for taking the time to check out my website. I am a Technical Account Manager for LinkIt!, an assessment solution software company in New York City. I grew up in Allentown, PA but I recently moved to Secaucus, NJ for work. I also recently graduated from Dickinson College with a B.S. in Computer Science and Data Analytics. My experience outside of my current job involves sports analytics, game theory analysis, automated testing, and software development that I have gained through research and work experience.

#### Role at LinkIt!
As an Technical Account Manager, I am responsible for solving technical support issues that educators need help with. LinkIt! is an everyday educational software solution that educators can use to adminster tests, sync grades, and generate extensive reports on their student's data. When technical complications arise, that's where I come in. Managing about 40 clients, I help manage rosters, upload data and analysis reports, and respond to any other applicable errors that our educations need assistance to solve. While my work mainly deals directly with the LinkIt! platform, I also work heavily with SQL coding and Salesforce, a customer resource management portal.

#### Technical Background
During Summer 2022, I completed a data analytics internship for Dickinson's athletics department where I helped analyze data on recruits and the men's basketball team. For the past two summers (2023 and 2024), I completed a software development internship at B. Braun Medical working with the R&D Digital Tech department in Allentown. My main task at B. Braun was to work on unit testing and code coverage for their DoseTracÂ© Enterprise software.

#### Research
For the past two years I have worked with Professors Barry Tesman and Eren Bilen at Dickinson to investigate the significance of the tipoff in professional basketball. In August 2023, I presented the first iteration of our work at the MAA's MathFest in Tampa, Florida. This past winter, we finalized our publication on our work which is currently in submission review. We also had a featured article about our work on the Dickinson newsletter (seen on my homepage!).

In addition, my current project is doing research revolving around the use of neural networks in Python to find an optimal strategy at winning "Turning Point" (also known as Shut the Box) an old math-faceted board game which I recently created an online version of - found on the home page of my website under my personal project section. I recommend that you check it out!

#### School Involvement
At school, I was both a Resident Advisor and a tour guide for two years, and I have been the assistant coach and treasurer for our club baseball team for the past three years too. Also, as of this past winter, I recently became a founding father of an associate chapter of Alpha Epsilon Pi at my school.

#### Fun Facts and Interests
Some fun facts about me: I am a diehard Texas Rangers fan, I have been playing baseball consistently since I was about five years old, I play disc golf and golf when the weather is nice, and I love working out.

As for the fields I am particularly interested in: I love working on personal projects that involve sports, especially fantasy sports projections and sports betting models. I am also extremely interested in working in fields such as educational and medical software.
