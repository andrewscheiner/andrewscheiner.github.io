Hello! My name is Andrew Scheiner and thank you for taking the time to check out my new website hosted by GitHub pages.
I live in Allentown, Pennsylvania and I am currently a sophomore at Dickinson College (Carlisle, PA) double majoring in both Computer Science and Data Analytics. 
At school, I am a Resident Advisor, tour guide, and an executive/coach/captain for our club baseball team.
My experience in my fields of interest includes data analysis and visualization, app and web development, research, and coding through college courses and jobs.
During Summer 2022, I completed a data analytics internship for Dickinson's athletics department and this past summer (2023), I completed a software development internship at B. Braun Medical working with the R&D Digital Tech department in Allentown. My main task at B. Braun was to work on unit testing and code coverage for their DoseTracÂ© Enterprise software. In addition, in summer 2023, I presented at the MAA's MathFest in Tampa, Florida for research I completed on investigating the significance of the jumpball in professional basketball.

Some fun facts about me: I am a diehard Texas Rangers fan, I have been playing baseball consistently since I was about five years old (I am currently still playing with my college's club baseball team), I am a video game enthusiast, and I love working out.

Please feel free to check out my socials included on the bottom of the page and please email me with any questions you might have!
